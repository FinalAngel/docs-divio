# Quickstart

Furo is distributed on [PyPI]. To use the theme in your Sphinx project:

1. Install Furo in documentation's build environment.

   ```
   pip install furo
   ```

2. Update the `html_theme` in `conf.py`.

   ```py
   html_theme = "furo"
   ```

3. Your Sphinx documentation's HTML pages will now be generated with this theme! ðŸŽ‰
