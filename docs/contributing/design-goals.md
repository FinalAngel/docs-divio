# Design Goals

```{todo}
Write this.
```

- why I wrote this.
  - good navigational capabilities in sidebar
  - "content in the middle" three-column layout
  - inspired by justthedocs and mkdocs-material
- what were the guiding ideas?
  - content is the focus
  - more stuff is not more good
  - graceful degradation
  - no need to look the same everywhere
